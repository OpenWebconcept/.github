üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è What is the Open Web Concept

The Open Web concept arose from the conviction that digital services for municipalities can be more innovative and cheaper. The collaboration aims for practical cooperation with municipalities and suppliers to realize further development, flexibility, and continuity. Municipalities jointly develop online applications and data services within the Open Web concept.

We do not work together in an organization but see ourselves as a movement. The philosophy "Open Web Concept" is based on:

- WordPress: the world's most used CMS, which automatically ensures more development
- Open architecture: Use of Open Source software and data storage independent of the application, which allows for code reuse and data storage
- Free market forces: less dependence on suppliers with fixed patterns and development processes and roadmaps
- Open cooperation between government and the market: both municipalities as market parties share the market share of the online applications

We believe in an open and pragmatic approach in which every municipality can participate and make a proportional contribution to the community.
